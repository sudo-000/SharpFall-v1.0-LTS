# A better Pianofall - Sharpfall

Since EmK530 is stop maintaining this version of Sharpfall and moving on to unity 2023, I'm going to take up this project and keep updating it during this period until the new version comes out. 

Sharpfall 1.0 is created with unity 2021 LTS, you'll need to download this version of the editor if you want to customize it based on your needs. 

### Changes I made so far: 

Fix shadows

Lower floor and wider vision

Make note blocks more shiny
